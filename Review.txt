1. In line 235 through 237:

    // Set initial direction of switching and previous voltage.
            dir = 1;
            Vprev = 0;
    
    Review: It's assumed that the direction of the ferroelectric field
    starts on the falling side, which means IF the minimum ferroelectric
    voltage is below zero, you'd first have to excite the ferroelectric
    to Vmin before you can actually excite it with a positive voltage
    for switching.
